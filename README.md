####Impressions

I thought this was a really fun project. The timeline of a little over a week to implement the game is perfect, as it is enough time to build something cool, but not so much time that you get consumed adding every little detail until it is perfect. I found that I was able to work on this game bit by bit every day and in the end had a little time left over to go back and reevaluate my code's design, which is a great way for this class to start.
