Title: Hook Line Sinker
Author: Grayson Wise

Hook Line and Sinker is a side-scrolling adventure game about one 
of the oldest rivalries in existence: man versus fish. You play as Phil, 
a salt of the earth fisherman out to make a living. Using the arrow keys
and space bar, try to catch all the fish in the lake, but be sure to 
make it to land in time for dinner! Oh, and watch out for those 
pesky sharks! 

Controls:
	Up/Down Arrows: Raise/Lower your fishing hook
	Left/Right Arrows: Move your boat
	Space Bar: Reel in Hook
	Mouse Click: Freeze Sharks

Objective:
	Catch all the fish before the timer runs out!
	
Level 1: Fish are swimming beneath you. When they are right next to your
	hook, click space bar to catch them! If you lined it up correctly, 
	you will successfully catch the fish! If not, you'll reel in an 
	empty line. If you catch all the fish before time runs out, you can 
	advance to level two!
		
Level 2: Now, sharks are swimming among the fish. You'll need to 
	avoid them. Using the mouse, you can click on a shark to freeze it
	temporarily. If you catch all the fish before time runs out without 
	hitting any sharks, you win!
