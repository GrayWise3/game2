Title: Hook Line and Sinker
Author: Grayson Wise

Hook Line and Sinker is a side-scrolling adventure game about one 
of the oldest rivalries in existence: man versus fish. You play as Phil, 
a salt of the earth fisherman out to make a living. Using the arrow keys
and space bar, try to catch all the fish in the lake, but be sure to 
make it to land in time for dinner!

Controls:
	Up/Down Arrows: Raise/Lower your fishing hook
	Left/Right Arrows: Move boat
	Space Bar: Reel in hook
	R key: Toggle Rubber Hook

Objective:
	Catch as many fish as possible and make it to the end before
	the timer runs out!
	
Level 1: Fish are swimming beneath you. When they are right next to your
	hook, click space bar to catch them! If you lined it up correctly, 
	you will successfully catch the fish! If not, you'll reel in an 
	empty line. Once you have caught all the fish and reached the dock, 
	you will advance to level two!
		
Level 2: Now, electric eels are swimming among the fish. You'll need to 
	use a rubberized hook to catch them! Click "r" to toggle whether
	or not your hook is rubberized. Also introducing fighting fish!
	You'll have to click the space bar rapidly if you hope to reel
	them in. Once you have caught all the fish and eels and made it 
	safely to the dock, you have beaten the game!
